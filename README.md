# 2. Prerequisites
We have tested the library in **Ubuntu 16.04** and **18.04**, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

## Pangolin
We use [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 3.0. Tested with OpenCV 3.2.0 and 4.4.0**.

## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

## DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.

## Python
Required to calculate the alignment of the trajectory with the ground truth. **Required Numpy module**.

* (win) http://www.python.org/downloads/windows
* (deb) `sudo apt install libpython2.7-dev`
* (mac) preinstalled with osx

## ROS (optional)

We provide some examples to process input of a monocular, monocular-inertial, stereo, stereo-inertial or RGB-D camera using ROS. Building these examples is optional. These have been tested with ROS Melodic under Ubuntu 18.04.

# 3. Building ORB-SLAM3 library and examples

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3.git ORB_SLAM3
```

We provide a script `build.sh` to build the *Thirdparty* libraries and *ORB-SLAM3*. Please make sure you have installed all required dependencies (see section 2). Execute:
```
cd ORB_SLAM3
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will create **libORB_SLAM3.so**  at *lib* folder and the executables in *Examples* folder.

# 4. Running ORB-SLAM3 with your camera

Directory `Examples` contains several demo programs and calibration files to run ORB-SLAM3 in all sensor configurations with Intel Realsense cameras T265 and D435i. The steps needed to use your own camera are: 

1. Calibrate your camera following `Calibration_Tutorial.pdf` and write your calibration file `your_camera.yaml`

2. Modify one of the provided demos to suit your specific camera model, and build it

3. Connect the camera to your computer using USB3 or the appropriate interface

4. Run ORB-SLAM3. For example, for our D435i camera, we would execute:

```
./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/stereo_inertial_realsense_D435i Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/RealSense_D435i.yaml
```


### Version 2  How to run | Usage

Mono Image
```commandline
./Examples/Stereo/stereo_euroc ./Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Examples/Stereo/EuRoC.yaml dataset/V1_01_easy ./Examples/Stereo/EuRoC_TimeStamps/V101.txt
```

Stereo Images
```commandline
./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/stereo_inertial_tum_vi ./Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/TUM-VI.yaml dataset/dataset-corridor4_512_16/mav0/cam0/data dataset/dataset-corridor4_512_16/mav0/cam1/data ./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/TUM_TimeStamps/dataset-corridor4_512.txt ./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/TUM_IMU/dataset-corridor4_512.txt dataset-corridor4
```

# 5. EuRoC Examples
[EuRoC dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) was recorded with two pinhole cameras and an inertial sensor. We provide an example script to launch EuRoC sequences in all the sensor configurations.

1. Download a sequence (ASL format) from http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets

2. Open the script "euroc_examples.sh" in the root of the project. Change **pathDatasetEuroc** variable to point to the directory where the dataset has been uncompressed. 

3. Execute the following script to process all the sequences with all sensor configurations:
```
./euroc_examples
```

## Evaluation
EuRoC provides ground truth for each sequence in the IMU body reference. As pure visual executions report trajectories centered in the left camera, we provide in the "evaluation" folder the transformation of the ground truth to the left camera reference. Visual-inertial trajectories use the ground truth from the dataset.

Execute the following script to process sequences and compute the RMS ATE:
```
./euroc_eval_examples
```

# 6. TUM-VI Examples
[TUM-VI dataset](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset) was recorded with two fisheye cameras and an inertial sensor.

1. Download a sequence from https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset and uncompress it.

2. Open the script "tum_vi_examples.sh" in the root of the project. Change **pathDatasetTUM_VI** variable to point to the directory where the dataset has been uncompressed. 

3. Execute the following script to process all the sequences with all sensor configurations:
```
./tum_vi_examples
```

## Evaluation
In TUM-VI ground truth is only available in the room where all sequences start and end. As a result the error measures the drift at the end of the sequence. 

Execute the following script to process sequences and compute the RMS ATE:
```
./tum_vi_eval_examples
```

# 7. ROS Examples

### Building the nodes for mono, mono-inertial, stereo, stereo-inertial and RGB-D
Tested with ROS Melodic and ubuntu 18.04.

1. Add the path including *Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM3* to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable. Open .bashrc file:
  ```
  gedit ~/.bashrc
  ```
and add at the end the following line. Replace PATH by the folder where you cloned ORB_SLAM3:

  ```
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:PATH/ORB_SLAM3/Examples/ROS
  ```
  
2. Execute `build_ros.sh` script:

  ```
  chmod +x build_ros.sh
  ./build_ros.sh
  ```
  
### Running Monocular Node
For a monocular input from topic `/camera/image_raw` run node ORB_SLAM3/Mono. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the monocular examples above.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Mono PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```

### Running Monocular-Inertial Node
For a monocular input from topic `/camera/image_raw` and an inertial input from topic `/imu`, run node ORB_SLAM3/Mono_Inertial. Setting the optional third argument to true will apply CLAHE equalization to images (Mainly for TUM-VI dataset).

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Mono PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE [EQUALIZATION]	
  ```

### Running Stereo Node
For a stereo input from topic `/camera/left/image_raw` and `/camera/right/image_raw` run node ORB_SLAM3/Stereo. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. For Pinhole camera model, if you **provide rectification matrices** (see Examples/Stereo/EuRoC.yaml example), the node will recitify the images online, **otherwise images must be pre-rectified**. For FishEye camera model, rectification is not required since system works with original images:

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Stereo PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE ONLINE_RECTIFICATION
  ```

### Running Stereo-Inertial Node
For a stereo input from topics `/camera/left/image_raw` and `/camera/right/image_raw`, and an inertial input from topic `/imu`, run node ORB_SLAM3/Stereo_Inertial. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file, including rectification matrices if required in a similar way to Stereo case:

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Stereo_Inertial PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE ONLINE_RECTIFICATION [EQUALIZATION]	
  ```
  
### Running RGB_D Node
For an RGB-D input from topics `/camera/rgb/image_raw` and `/camera/depth_registered/image_raw`, run node ORB_SLAM3/RGBD. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the RGB-D example above.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 RGBD PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```

**Running ROS example:** Download a rosbag (e.g. V1_02_medium.bag) from the EuRoC dataset (http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets). Open 3 tabs on the terminal and run the following command at each tab for a Stereo-Inertial configuration:
  ```
  roscore
  ```
  
  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Stereo_Inertial Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Stereo-Inertial/EuRoC.yaml true
  ```
  
  ```
  rosbag play --pause V1_02_medium.bag /cam0/image_raw:=/camera/left/image_raw /cam1/image_raw:=/camera/right/image_raw /imu0:=/imu
  ```
  
Once ORB-SLAM3 has loaded the vocabulary, press space in the rosbag tab.

**Remark:** For rosbags from TUM-VI dataset, some play issue may appear due to chunk size. One possible solution is to rebag them with the default chunk size, for example:
  ```
  rosrun rosbag fastrebag.py dataset-room1_512_16.bag dataset-room1_512_16_small_chunks.bag
  ```

# 8. Running time analysis
A flag in `include\Config.h` activates time measurements. It is necessary to uncomment the line `#define REGISTER_TIMES` to obtain the time stats of one execution which is shown at the terminal and stored in a text file(`ExecTimeMean.txt`).

# 9. Calibration
You can find a tutorial for visual-inertial calibration and a detailed description of the contents of valid configuration files at  `Calibration_Tutorial.pdf`

# ORB-SLAM3 SETUP
You'll have the best chance of getting ORB SLAM 3 working if you follow these instructions exactly, including using a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 installation on a newly created virtual machine.

Make sure your machine has at least 16GB RAM and 4 cores. The recommended RAM is 32GB. But if this is not possible, you can try 4 GB RAM, but the results will not be optimal

Install the VMware Workstation Player virtual machine. I did this on my Windows 10 desktop PC. During setup, adjust the hardware to use the maximum recommended amount of RAM, and 4 processor cores. Every time you start a VM, shut down everything running on the PC to allow as much RAM to be used by ORB_SLAM3 as possible.

Download the Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS iso. In the ORB-SLAM3 Setup process, I used Ubuntu version 22.04 LTS

[Ubuntu Iso](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

After setting up the OS, you may want to connect a USB device, such as a drive where you store data. You can do this via the top left tab, but by default all the options are grayed out. To fix this, shut down the VM, navigate to your VM (mine is in Documents/Virtual Machines), and open the .vmx file with a text editor. Delete the following lines

## 1. Install Dependencies
```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security main"
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libdc1394-22-dev libjasper-dev
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libboost-all-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module
```
Make sure that you install every Dependency required to run ORB-SLAM3

# Install Prerequisites
## 1. Install OpenCv
You need to install opencv on version 4.2.0. 

make sure to follow these steps
```
cd ~
mkdir Dev && cd Dev
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
cd opencv
```
After adapting to the opencv directory, then run 'nano ./modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp'. Then add the following constants just below the module you entered :
```
#define AV_CODEC_FLAG_GLOBAL_HEADER (1 << 22)
#define CODEC_FLAG_GLOBAL_HEADER AV_CODEC_FLAG_GLOBAL_HEADER
#define AVFMT_RAWPICTURE 0x0020
```
Now build it
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D WITH_CUDA=OFF -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
make -j 3
sudo make install
```
## 2.Install Pangolin
We will use an older commit version of Pangolin for compatibility.
```
cd ~/Dev
git clone https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.git
cd Pangolin 
git checkout 86eb4975fc4fc8b5d92148c2e370045ae9bf9f5d
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake .. -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 
make -j 3 
sudo make install
```
## 3. Install DBoW2
```
cd ~/Dev
git clone https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2.git
cd DBoW2
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 
sudo make install
```
## 4. Install g2o
```
cd ~/Dev
git clone https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o.git 
cd g2o
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 
sudo make install
```
## 5. ORB-SLAM3
```
git clone https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3.git 
cd ORB_SLAM3
```
We need to change the header file `gedit ./include/LoopClosing.h` at line 51 from
```
Eigen::aligned_allocator<std::pair<const KeyFrame*, g2o::Sim3> > > KeyFrameAndPose;
to
Eigen::aligned_allocator<std::pair<KeyFrame *const, g2o::Sim3> > > KeyFrameAndPose; 
```
in order to make this comiple. Now, we can comiple ORB-SLAM3 and it dependencies as DBoW2 and g2o.

Now Simply just run (if you encounter compiler, try to run the this shell script 2 or 3 more time.)
```
./build.sh
```
# Command to run the datasets:
Run the following in the `~/ORB_SLAM3/` file.

Make sure you have downloaded the dataset

Then, choose one of the following to run. A map viewer as well as an image viewer should appear after it finishes setup.
```
# Mono
./Examples/Monocular/mono_euroc ./Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Examples/Monocular/EuRoC.yaml ~/Datasets/EuRoc/MH01 ./Examples/Monocular/EuRoC_TimeStamps/MH01.txt dataset-MH01_mono

# Mono + Inertial
./Examples/Monocular-Inertial/mono_inertial_euroc ./Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Examples/Monocular-Inertial/EuRoC.yaml ~/Datasets/EuRoc/MH01 ./Examples/Monocular-Inertial/EuRoC_TimeStamps/MH01.txt dataset-MH01_monoi

# Stereo
./Examples/Stereo/stereo_euroc ./Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Examples/Stereo/EuRoC.yaml ~/Datasets/EuRoc/MH01 ./Examples/Stereo/EuRoC_TimeStamps/MH01.txt dataset-MH01_stereo

# Stereo + Inertial
./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/stereo_inertial_euroc ./Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/EuRoC.yaml ~/Datasets/EuRoc/MH01 ./Examples/Stereo-Inertial/EuRoC_TimeStamps/MH01.txt dataset-MH01_stereoi
```
The thing you need to pay attention to is that for each path above, it must be adjusted to the location of the file that will be accessed on your laptop

Replace all of `#include <Eigen/(any packages)> to #include <eigen3/Eigen/(any packages)>.`

For example:
```
#include <Eigen/Core>
to
#include <eigen3/Eigen/Core>
```
These changes have to made in all the files using the Eigen dependency in the `ORB_SLAM3/include/` folder.
